# README

This repository contains documentation for notebooks and stores the best models.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me at **aniltaysi@gmail.com**.

Thank you!


NOTE: I have added the .h5 format of spam_detection model, so it can be loaded as "spam_detector_with_vectorization/spam_detector_with_vectorization.h5" as well, using TensorFlow.
